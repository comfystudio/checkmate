                            <p><strong>This Agreement</strong></p>
                            <p>This Agreement consists of the following terms and conditions (hereinafter the "General Terms") and terms and conditions, if any, specific to use of individual Services (hereinafter the "Service Specific Terms"). The General Terms and Service Specific Terms are collectively referred to as the "Terms". In the event of a conflict between the General Terms and Service Specific Terms, the Service Specific Terms shall prevail.</p>

                            <p><strong>Acceptance of the Terms</strong></p>
                            <p>You must accept the General Terms before being able to use the Services. If You do not agree to the General Terms, You cannot use any of Our Services. If You agree to the General Terms and do not agree to any Service Specific Terms, You cannot use the corresponding Service. You will be deemed to have accepted the Terms when You commence using the Services.</p>

                            <p><strong>Description of Service</strong></p>
                            <p>We provide an array of services for creating property inventory reports (‘Report’ or ‘Reports’). This includes an online control panel which allows You to amend Reports and store or work with them in electronic format as well as share the Report via unique User ID. The online control panel also allows You to request electronic signature from third parties. As part of the service a mobile application for Android and Apple devices is also provided. You may use the Services for Your personal and business use or for internal business purposes in the organisation that You represent. You may connect to the Services using any Internet browser supported by the Services. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Internet and the equipment necessary to use the Services. You can create and edit Content with Your user account and if You choose to do so, You can publish and share such Content. For the purposes of the Service, Content is defined as property inventory lists for the purposes of letting, and comments and photographs relating to the same.</p>

                            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, Check Mate provides an inventory service only. Check Mate does not provide a Tenancy Deposit Scheme or dispute resolution service. Check Mate is not an independent adjudicator. Check Mate accepts no liability whatsoever in relation to the Content uploaded or amended by any User of the Service or any reliance thereon.</p>

                            <p><strong>Modification of Terms of Service</strong></p>
                            <p>We may modify the Terms upon notice to You at any time. You will be provided notice of any such modification by electronic mail or by publishing the changes on the Check Mate website. Your continued use of the Service after notice of any change to the Terms will be deemed to be Your agreement to the amended Terms.</p>

                            <p><strong>User Sign up Obligations</strong></p>
                            <p>You need to sign up to obtain a User ID and to create a user account and/or download an application by providing all required information and confirming acceptance of the Terms in order to access or use the Services. If You represent an organisation and wish to use the Services for corporate internal use, We recommend that You, and all other users from Your organisation, sign up for user accounts by providing Your corporate contact information. In particular, We recommend that You use Your corporate email address. You agree to: a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about Yourself as prompted by the sign up process; and b) maintain and promptly update the information provided during sign up to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If You provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, or if Check Mate has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, Check Mate may terminate Your user account and refuse current or future use of any or all of the Services without prejudice to any other legal remedies which Check Mate may have.</p>

                            <p><strong>Personal Information and Privacy</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Fees and Payments</strong></p>
                            <p>You may access the Services on a Pay as You Go basis or on a minimum term yearly subscription plan.</p>

                            <p>Pay As You Go Account</p>

                            <p>We may allow You to pay for some Services in advance on a Pay as You Go basis (see Price Plan).</p>
                            <p>When You pay in advance, We will apply credits to Your Pay As You Go Account, and deduct Charges from that credit for those Services You pay for using this Account. We will deduct Charges from that credit at the rate of £20 per Report.</p>

                            <p>As Charges are incurred they will be deducted from amounts credited against Your Pay As You Go Account. Charges are deducted each time that You request a new report.</p>

                            <p>If, at the time We attempt to deduct a Charge from Your Pay As You Go Account, You do not have enough credit on Your Pay As You Go Account to pay that Charge, that Charge will fail and You will not be able to use the Service for which We were attempting to Charge You.</p>

                            <p><strong>Minimum Term Subscription Plan</strong></p>

                            <p>You will have to agree to stay with Us for a minimum period of time which We call the “Minimum Term”. This Minimum Term will be agreed with You and You will have to pay a regular monthly charge for this which We call the “Monthly Charge”.</p>

                            <p>You can find details of Charges in Our Price Plan which can be found on Our Website.</p>

                            <p><strong>Upgrades and Renewals</strong></p>
                            <p>If We offer and You accept an Upgrade or Renewal then a new Minimum Term will be agreed with You and You will have to pay the upgraded or renewed Monthly Charge for the rest of the new Minimum Term.</p>

                            <p>Your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period unless You inform us that You do not wish to renew the subscription. The monthly charge will be charged to the payment method last used by You. If You would like the payment for the renewal to be made through a different payment method or if You do not wish to renew the subscription, You agree to inform us at least seven days prior to the renewal date. In the event of termination of the subscription, You will not be eligible for a refund of the monthly charge or it's part or the unused portion of the subscription period. Check Mate reserves the right to change the monthly charge and to charge for use of Services that are currently available free of charge. Information on the subscription options and charges for all paid Services is available on the Price Plan available from Our website.</p>

                            <p><strong>Auto-renewal</strong></p>
                            <p>The Minimum Term Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each Minimum Term for a further Minimum Term of 1 year unless either party gives the other written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the relevant Minimum Term.</p>
